            <p class="my-4">At Winepress Ministries, we take great joy in celebrating the gracious women who enrich our church community. Our women are renowned for their kindness, compassion, and unwavering faith. They embody the ideals of Proverbs 31, being women "clothed with strength and dignity."</p>
            <p class="my-4">Proverbs 31:26 beautifully captures the essence of our gracious women: "She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue" (ESV). This scripture reminds us of the profound impact our women have on our church and the lives they touch.</p>
            <p class="my-4">In addition to their remarkable qualities, our gracious women are dedicated to supporting one another and those in need. They provide an environment of fellowship and spiritual growth, fostering an atmosphere of love and faith.</p>
