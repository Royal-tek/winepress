            <p class="my-4">High Flyers: In Winepress Ministries, we believe that our High Flying Youths are not just the future of our church but also the leaders of tomorrow. With a strong foundation in faith and values, they are well-equipped to soar to new heights in their lives. We encourage them to embrace their potential and make a positive impact on the world.</p>
            <p class="my-4">In 1 Timothy 4:12, the Bible reminds us that age is not a barrier to making a difference: "Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity" (NIV). Our High Flying Youths are encouraged to live out these principles in their everyday lives.</p>
            <p class="my-4">We provide a supportive and nurturing environment for our young people, where they can grow spiritually, develop leadership skills, and engage in meaningful community service. Through a combination of mentorship, worship, and educational programs, we empower our youths to be positive influences in their families, church, and society at large.</p>
