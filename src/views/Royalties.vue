            <p class="my-4">Our Royalties Program at Winepress Ministries is dedicated to nurturing the faith of our youngest members. We believe that children are a precious gift from God and should be raised in the ways of the Lord. Proverbs 22:6 provides our guiding principle: "Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it" (ESV).</p>
            <p class="my-4">Our program offers engaging lessons and activities designed to help children grow in their understanding of God's love and teachings. Through a combination of play, worship, and age-appropriate biblical education, we aim to lay a strong foundation of faith in their hearts.</p>
            <p class="my-4">We welcome families to join us as we embark on this wonderful journey of spiritual growth and discovery with our Royal Kids. It is our privilege to be entrusted with the responsibility of nurturing the faith of the next generation.</p>
